A library of indispensable ShortCodes for ClassicPress (and WordPress without Blocks) Websites.

== Description ==

This plugin is currently under development.
Known issues.
- in Excerpts the ShortCodes do not work, thus on archives they do not render.
- some sanitization options do not yet default to a safe sanitize, it is up to the user to choose one.

TukuToi ShortCodes provides you with a bunch of ShortCodes useful for dynamic webdevelopment.
Basically the entire WordPress API has been "ShortCode-ified" in this Plugin. You can display any kind of site, post, user, taxonomy or else Information dynamically.

The ShortCodes can be nested inside each other, where it makes sense, the ShortCodes can be used both as enclosed or not encosing ShortCodes and take ShortCodes as attributes as well.

One of the most powerful features in the Plugin is a "conditional" ShortCode allowing you to write "if/else/elseif" statements directly in your favourite WordPress Text Editor like so:
```
[tkt_scs_conditional left="The past is WP" right="The Future is CP" operator="eqv" else="The Compared values where not true!"]
  The Compared values where true!
[/tkt_scs_conditional]
```

You can easily register your own ShortCodes as well, and even pass new Attributes to existing ShortCodes. 

Documentation lives direclty inside the ShortCodes, as with a special parameter passed to any of the ShortCodes, each attribute will be shown on the site with its expected content type.

This is like a Page builder, just that you will use HTML to build your layouts and then make them dynamic with ShortCodes.

ShortCodes available so far:

Blog Info [tkt_scs_bloginfo]
Post Info [tkt_scs_postinfo]
User Info [tkt_scs_userinfo]
Term Info [tkt_scs_terminfo]
Post Terms Info [tkt_scs_post_termsinfo]
User Meta Data [tkt_scs_usermeta key="first_name"]
Term Meta Data [tkt_scs_termmeta item="3" key="mikes"]
Post Meta Data [tkt_scs_postmeta key="testing_the_field"]
Conditional ShortCode [tkt_scs_conditional left="val" right="val" operator="eqv" else="val"]Anything[/tkt_scs_conditional]

All ShortCodes take exactly the same arguments as the functions.
All ShortCodes can be inserted in the Post Editors using a Dymamic GUI that lets you compose the ShortCode attributes, with custom values or where appropriate with existing "object properties".


== Installation ==

Just like any other Plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
2. This is the second screen shot

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
